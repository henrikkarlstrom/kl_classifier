# Gender research classifier

This is an example of a machine learning model to determine whether a particular text is likely to be research with perspectives on gender. The model is trained on a data set of 11447 Norwegian research articles that have been manually classified as part of a project to describe Norwegian research with gender perspectives (see [the project page for details](https://osf.io/gm9wb/).

This repository contains the training data, a script for training different types of classification models (a null model for evaluation benchmarking, a naive Bayes model and a lasso regularized regression model) and evaluating them, and a script for tuning the chosen regression model for better model performance. It also contains the model object itself.

# Model training and evaluation

After training three models using the default parameters, the following accuracy and ROC curve metrics were observed:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./plots/accuracy_roc_curve_plot.png")
```

On the basis of the superior performance of the default lasso regression model, this was chosen for further tuning, resulting in the following post-tuning and fitting performance:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./plots/roc_curve_confusion_matrix_plot.png")
```

# Variable importance

The presence of the following features were found to contribute the most to choice of classification:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./plots/vip_plot.png")
```
